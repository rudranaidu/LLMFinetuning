Loss (0.7007)
The loss is a measure of how well the model is doing on the training data. It's calculated using a loss function, which compares the model's predictions with the actual labels.
The loss function calculates the difference between the model's predictions and the actual labels. A common loss function for binary classification problems like this is Binary Cross-Entropy Loss.
In our case, the loss is 0.7007, which means the model's predictions are not perfect, and there's room for improvement. A lower loss value would indicate better performance.

Gradient Norm (2.9846608638763428)
The gradient norm is a measure of how large the updates are that the model is making to its weights. 
It's calculated as the magnitude of the gradient vector. Think of the gradient as a direction in which the model needs to move to minimize the loss.
A large gradient norm means the model is making large updates, which can be good for learning quickly, but also risks overshooting the optimal solution.

Learning Rate (4.9550000000000005e-05)
The learning rate controls how large the updates are that the model makes to its weights. A high learning rate means the model learns quickly, but may overshoot the optimal solution. A low learning rate means the model learns slowly, but is more stable.
In this case, the learning rate is 4.955e-05, which is a relatively small value. This means the model is making small, incremental updates to its weights.

Epoch (0.02)
The epoch is a measure of how far through the training process we are. An epoch is a single pass through the entire training dataset.
In this case, the epoch is 0.02, which means we're very early in the training process. The model has only seen a small fraction of the training data so far.
To put it all together:
The model is making small, stable updates to its weights (gradient norm is small).
The model is learning slowly, but stably (learning rate is small).
The model is early in the training process (epoch is small).
The model's predictions are not perfect, but it's getting better (loss is moderate).
As training progresses, we would expect the loss to decrease, the gradient norm to stabilize, and the model's performance to improve.
